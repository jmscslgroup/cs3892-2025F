# Shared code for cs3892, cee3890, cs 5892, Fall 2025
This repository provides some shared code in class, and is updated over time with new shared code.


## Preliminary things to download
* MATLAB: https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html
* Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
* Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

## Actions to perform after download

### Packages for MATLAB
* MATLAB
* Simulink
* Control System Toolbox
* Embedded Coder
* MATLAB Coder
* ROS Toolbox
* Signal Processing Toolbox
* Simulink Coder
* Simulink Compiler
* Stateflow
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

### After downloading Docker:
Run the following command:

```
docker pull sprinkjm/rosempty
```

This gives you a local install of Ros on your machine that runs linux with the exact version of Ros already installed, without having to partition your hard drive or learn which version of Ubuntu you need to install in order to get a version of Ros that runs on our car.
